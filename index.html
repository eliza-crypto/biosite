      <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Eliza Tulod and I am a graphic and web design student at El Camino High School.  
        I was born and raised in the Philippines and moved to Oceanside, California.  
        I really enjoy drinking chai and Thai iced tea.  
        My hobbies are sewing, thrifting, and playing Roblox.  
        When I thrift, I usually look for patterns such as polka dots and stripes.  
        Lastly, I love listening to Radiohead.
