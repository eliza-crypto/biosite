        My name is Eliza Tulod, and I am currently a web and graphic design student at El Camino High School. 
        I was born and raised in the Philippines before moving to Oceanside, California, where I continue to explore my love for creativity and technology. 
        Outside of school, I enjoy sewing, thrifting, playing Roblox, and sipping on chai or Thai iced tea. 
        I also have a big appreciation for music, especially Radiohead, which inspires me in both subtle and creative ways.

        In web design, I enjoy the process of combining creativity with technical skills. 
        Designing layouts, experimenting with colors, and coding websites give me the opportunity to express ideas in a new way, 
        while also learning skills that are useful for the future. 
        I like how web design connects both art and problem-solving, which makes each project exciting and challenging.

        Looking ahead, I hope to continue growing as both a designer and a student, whether that means pursuing web design, graphic design, or exploring other passions like biology. 
        No matter where the future takes me, I know the skills Iâ€™m learning now will help me think creatively, work hard, and keep finding joy in learning new things.
